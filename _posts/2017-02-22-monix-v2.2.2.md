description: TaskCircuitBreaker, memoizeOnSuccess, deferFutureAction, critical bug fixes
---

Version `2.2.2` is out now.

It is a minor release that's binary and source compatible with `2.2.x`.

In summary: 

- Implemented a circuit breaker for `Task`, for providing stability
  and preventing cascading failures in distributed systems
- Added `Task!.memoizeOnSuccess` and `Coeval!.memoizeOnSuccess`
  operators that only caches the result (with idempotency guarantees)
  for successful results, while re-evaluating the source on failures
- Added `Task.deferFutureAction` that helps with wrapping
  `Future`-enabled APIs without requiring `ExecutionContext` in the
  function signature, since `Task` can inject it for you
- Added `SingleAssignmentCancelable.plusOne` for helping with building
  `Consumer` objects
- Moved and redesigned exceptions in `monix.execution`
- `Task.sequence` now has lazy behavior in evaluating the given
  sequence (previously we were doing a `foldLeft` on that sequence,
  which could have strict behavior, depending on the collection type)
- Critical bugs fixed!

Details below!

### New Features

**[Issue #306](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/306)** -
Introduced a circuit breaker in `monix.eval.TaskCircuitBreaker`,
[see documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}docs/2x/eval/circuit-breaker.html):

A circuit breaker is used to provide stability and prevent cascading
failures in distributed systems:

```scala
import monix.eval._
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val circuitBreaker = TaskCircuitBreaker(
  maxFailures = 5,
  resetTimeout = 10.seconds
)

circuitBreaker.protect(problematicTask.timeout(1.second))
```

**[Issue #312](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/312)** -
Introduced the `Task!.memoizeOnSuccess` operator, 
[see documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}docs/2x/eval/task.html#memoize-only-on-success):

This `Task!.memoizeOnSuccess` operator, caches the result (with
idempotency guarantees), just like the normal `memoize` operator, only
it does so only on a successful result, whereas if failures happens,
subsequent calls will retry evaluating the source until it succeeds:

```scala
var effect = 0

val source = Task.eval { 
  effect += 1
  if (effect < 3) throw new RuntimeException("dummy") 
  else effect
}

val cached = source.memoizeOnSuccess

val f1 = cached.runAsync // yields RuntimeException
val f2 = cached.runAsync // yields RuntimeException
val f3 = cached.runAsync // yields 3
val f4 = cached.runAsync // yields 3
```

**[Issue #313](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/313)** - 
On `Task` we added the `deferFutureAction` builder,
[see documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}docs/2x/eval/task.html#taskdeferfutureaction):

This helps with wrapping `Future`-enabled APIs, by being able to
specify a callback with an injected `Scheduler`:

```scala
def sumFuture(list: Seq[Int])(implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[Int] =
  Future(list.sum)

// Look Ma, no implicit ExecutionContext!
def sumTask(list: Seq[Int]): Task[Int] =
  Task.deferFutureAction { implicit scheduler =>
    sumFuture(list)
  }
```

**[Issue #325](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/325)**:
Added `SingleAssignmentCancelable.plusOne` builder,
[see documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}docs/2x/execution/cancelable.html#singleassignmentcancelable):

This `plusOne` function builds a `SingleAssignmentCancelable`
reference which also cancels an extra cancelable specified at
construction time, in addition to the underlying cancelable that gets
assigned later:

```scala
val c = {
  val guest = Cancelable(() => println("extra canceled"))
  SingleAssignmentCancelable.plusOne(guest)
}

c := Cancelable(() => println("primary canceled"))

c.cancel()
//=> extra canceled
//=> primary canceled
```

This helps with building `Consumer` objects that need to specify a 
cancelable that cancels the data source, plus whatever resources
the consumer itself has opened.

Build:

- enabled the Scala 
  [Migration Manager](https://github.com/typesafehub/migration-manager) 
  (MiMa) in `build.sbt` to check for backwards compatibility problems
- [Issue #322](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/322):
  Switch projects which use `CrossVersion.full/"org.scala-lang"` 
  to `CrossVersion.patch/scalaOrganization.value`

### Upgrading

To use the new version, include this in your `build.sbt` (and use
`%%%` for Scala.js):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "2.2.2"
```

The other projects from the [@Monix](https://github.com/monix) organization
have also been upgraded to depend on this new version.

**[shade](https://github.com/monix/shade)**, the Scala Memcached client:

```scala
dependencies += "io.monix" %% "shade" % "1.9.2"
```

**[monix-kafka](https://github.com/monix/monix-kafka)**, the Apache Kafka
integration:

```scala
// For Kafka 8
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-8" % "0.11"

// For Kafka 9
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-9" % "0.11"

// For Kafka 10
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-10" % "0.11"
```

Enjoy!
