This release is binary compatible with 2.0.x, being a bug fix release
release for [Issue #230](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/230):
Deadlocks when blocking threads due to `LocalBatchingExecutor`
(affects `Task` usage).

<!--more-->

Basically the implementation of
[LocalBatchingExecutor](https://github.com/monix/monix/blob/v2.0.3/monix-execution/jvm/src/main/scala/monix/execution/schedulers/LocalBatchingExecutor.scala)
assumed that the given `LocalRunnable` instances will not block
the current thread. However there are clearly cases in which
users and up blocking during a `LocalRunnable`. For example:

```scala
val source1 = Task(100)
val source2 = Task(200).onErrorHandleWith { case e: Exception => Task.raiseError(e) }

val derived = source1.map { x =>
  val r = Await.result(source2.runAsync, 10.seconds)
  r + x
}

val result = Await.result(derived.runAsync, 10.seconds)
```

This is clearly not idiomatic usage because
[blocking threads is evil](/docs/2x/best-practices/blocking.md),
however it does happen in code and it has to work. As can be seen in the
[committed fix](https://github.com/monix/monix/commit/6effcba053c26edec5fa9d9e5844bf8148d9be57)
the JVM-specific implementation for the `LocalBatchingExecutor` now
uses Scala's `BlockContext` to workaround this limitation of our
local trampoline.

Enjoy!
