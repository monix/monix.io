---

Version `2.2.1` is out now.

It is a major release that shouldn't be considered binary compatible with `2.1.x`,
even though it is source compatible. This is due to several operators being
changed in `Observable` and `Task`, but extension methods are provided for the older
versions, therefore source compatibility is maintained.

As a summary: the new `MVar` synchronization primitive, performance improvements
in `Observable.concatMap` and in the `Task` run-loop, new `SchedulerService`
interface for shutting down schedulers, bug fixes and upgrade to Cats 0.9.0.
See details below.

### New Synchronization Primitive: monix.eval.MVar

The `MVar` is a new synchronization primitive, a mutable location that can
be empty or contains a value, asynchronously blocking reads when empty and
blocking writes when full.

Use-cases:

1. As synchronized, thread-safe mutable variables
2. As channels, with `take` and `put` acting as "receive" and "send"
3. As a binary semaphore, with `take` and `put` acting as "acquire" and "release"

Read [the tutorial](/docs/2x/eval/mvar.html) or the
[api documentation]({{ site.api2x }}monix/eval/MVar.html).

### SchedulerService: for shutting down Schedulers

Sometimes there's a need to create a temporary `Scheduler` whose resources
need to be discarded. The new `SchedulerService` is a new interface that
adds `shutdown` and `awaitTermination` methods to the base `Scheduler`,
similar in spirit with `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService`.

Read
[the tutorial](/docs/2x/execution/scheduler.html#shutdown-with-schedulerservice)
or the
[api documentation]({{ site.api2x }}monix/execution/schedulers/SchedulerService.html).

### Performance Improvements

The `Task` run-loop has suffered from a performance regression in version 2.1.x,
due to safety reasons.

In this new release I managed to eliminate that regression and right now
the Monix Task has the best throughput among all the similar data type
implementations in Scala land, see
[github.com/rossabaker/benchmarks/pull/4](https://github.com/rossabaker/benchmarks/pull/4).

`Observable` also has performance improvements in `concatMap`, which is now
using the `getAndSet` platform intrinsics from Java 8 to speed up the
concurrency for the handling of `onComplete`. If you're into JVM concurrency, the
[implementation is beautiful](https://github.com/monix/monix/blob/v2.2.1/monix-reactive/shared/src/main/scala/monix/reactive/internal/operators/ConcatMapObservable.scala) ;-)

In addition to that, `Observable` has performance improvements for the
`bufferSliding` operator, as it was revealed in a recent benchmark
that it had terrible performance. Now it is fine :-)

### Upgrading

To use the new version, include this in your `build.sbt` (and use
`%%%` for Scala.js):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "2.2.1"
```

The other projects from the [@Monix](https://github.com/monix) organization
have also been upgraded to depend on this new version.

**[shade](https://github.com/monix/shade)**, the Scala Memcached client:

```scala
dependencies += "io.monix" %% "shade" % "1.9.1"
```

**[monix-kafka](https://github.com/monix/monix-kafka)**, the Apache Kafka
integration:

```scala
// For Kafka 8
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-8" % "0.10"

// For Kafka 9
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-9" % "0.10"

// For Kafka 10
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-10" % "0.10"
```

Enjoy!
