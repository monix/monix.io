Greetings,

Version `2.1.1` is out now, while version `2.1.0` was out
on [Nov 9](https://github.com/monix/monix/blob/master/CHANGES.md).
The official announcement was then postponed because we waited to see
if bug reports are going to happen. Today version `2.1.1` was
released, fixing such a problem.

To use the new version, include this in your `build.sbt` (and use
`%%%` for Scala.js):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "2.1.1"
```

The new version supports:

- Scala 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12
- [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) 0.6.x
- [Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/) 0.8.x
- [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) 7.2.x
- Java 6, 7, 8 and 9
- Android, at least since 2.x

The theme of the `2.1` release has been performance optimizations, in
some cases quite massive, improving `Task` and parallelizing work by
means of the new `Observable.mapAsync` or by `TaskSemaphore`.
