Version `2.2.3` is out now.

It is a minor release that's binary and source compatible with
`2.2.x`, fixing a critical bug that happens in Scala 2.12, due to
changes to how `flatMap` is implemented in `scala.concurrent.Future`:

- [Bug #330](https://github.com/monix/monix/issues/330):
  `Ack.Continue.transformWith` and `Ack.Stop.transformWith` 
  are not stack-safe

**Impact of this bug:** it does NOT impact most (probably all)
functionality in Monix, because Monix rarely flatMaps direct
`Continue` references (due to batching and optimizations) and we have
had extensive tests for long loops that could trigger this problem.

However this bug can be dangerous for people that have implemented the
communication protocol (as
[described in the docs](/docs/2x/reactive/observers.html#feeding-an-observer))
by themselves. If you're using Monix with Scala 2.12, then *upgrade
immediately*.

Upgrade should be safe, being binary compatible with all previous
`2.2.x` versions.

### Upgrading

To use the new version, include this in your `build.sbt` (and use
`%%%` for Scala.js):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "2.2.3"
```

The other projects from the [@Monix](https://github.com/monix) organization
have also been upgraded to depend on this new version.

**[shade](https://github.com/monix/shade)**, the Scala Memcached client:

```scala
dependencies += "io.monix" %% "shade" % "1.9.3"
```

**[monix-kafka](https://github.com/monix/monix-kafka)**, the Apache Kafka
integration:

```scala
// For Kafka 8
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-8" % "0.12"

// For Kafka 9
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-9" % "0.12"

// For Kafka 10
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix-kafka-10" % "0.12"
```

Enjoy!
