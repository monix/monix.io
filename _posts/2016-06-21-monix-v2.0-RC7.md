title: "Monix: Version 2.0-RC7 Released"

description: Scalaz 7.2 integration, TaskApp, new Scheduler builders, Atomic references
---

This release candidate fixes a bug in `Task.materializeAttempt` and
consequently `Task.onErrorHandleWith`. It also adds
[Scalaz](http://scalaz.org/) integration and a `TaskApp` to make your
friends jealous. Also the `Atomic` references in project `Sincron` are
being brought back into Monix proper, in `monix-execution`, because
project `Sincron` is for all intents and purposes part of Monix and
has no further ambitions.

See the published [API Documentation](/api/2.0-RC7/).

Bug fixes:

- [Issue #170](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/170): 
  `Task.materializeAttempt` doesn't work for `BindAsync`, leading to `onErrorHandleWith`
  not working with errors triggered in `flatMap` on async tasks
 
New Features:

- [Issue #171](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/171): 
   Add Scheduler builder on the JVM that allows specifying 
   just the `ExecutionModel`, piggybacking `global` otherwise   
- [Issue #174](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/174): 
  [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) integration (in addition to the 
  Cats integration) for FP goodness
- [Issue #175](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/175):
  Reintroduce all of project `Sincron` into `monix-execution`, which means
  that now `monix-execution` exposes `Atomic` references. This project
  was split from Monix, but the decision didn't make sense and the exposed
  functionality is super useful and in the spirit of `monix-execution`
- [Issue #176](https://github.com/monixio/monix/issues/176): now that we
  have `Task`, we introduce `TaskApp`, a safe `App` type that allows one
  to specify pure programs
  
New documentation pages:

- [Atomic](/docs/2x/execution/atomic.html)
- [Scalaz 7.2 Integration](/docs/2x/intro/scalaz72.html)
- [Observable](/docs/2x/reactive/observable.html) (just introduction, work in progress)
