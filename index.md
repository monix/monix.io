Asynchronous Programming for Scala and [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/).

[![Gitter]({{ site.baseurl }}public/images/gitter.svg)]({{ site.github.chat }})

## Overview

Monix is a high-performance Scala / Scala.js library for
composing asynchronous and event-based programs, exposing high-level
types, such as observable sequences that are exposed as asynchronous streams,
expanding on the [observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern),
strongly inspired by [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) and by [Scalaz](http://scalaz.org/),
but designed from the ground up  for back-pressure and made to cleanly interact
with Scala's standard library, compatible out-of-the-box with the
[Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) protocol.

Highlights:

- exposes the kick-ass `Observable`, `Task` and `Coeval`
- modular, only use what you need
- the base library has no third-party dependencies
- strives to be idiomatic Scala and encourages referential transparency,
  but is built to be faster than alternatives
- is a [Typelevel project](http://typelevel.org/projects/)
- designed for true asynchronicity, running on both the
  JVM and [Scala.js](http://scala-js.org)
- really good test coverage and API documentation as a project policy

### Download and Usage

The packages are published on Maven Central.

- Old 1.x release: `{{ site.version1x }}` 
  ([download source archive]({{ site.github.repo }}/archive/v{{ site.version1x }}.zip))
- Current 2.x release: `{{ site.version2x }}` 
  ([download source archive]({{ site.github.repo }}/archive/v{{ site.version2x }}.zip))

For the old 1.x release (use the `%%%` for Scala.js):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.monifu" %% "monifu" % "{{ site.version1x }}"
```

For the 2.x release (use the `%%%` for Scala.js):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "{{ site.version2x }}"
```

Monix 2.0 is modular by design, so you can pick and choose:

- **monix-execution**: the low-level execution environment, or more precisely
  `Scheduler`, `Cancelable`, `CancelableFuture` and `Atomic`
- **monix-eval**: for controlling evaluation by means of `Task`,
  `Coeval` and `TaskApp`
- **monix-reactive**: async `Observable` streams
- **monix**: provides all of the above

Optional integrations:

- **monix-cats**: exposes Typelevel [Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/)
  type-class instances, see [the intro](/docs/2x/intro/cats.html)
- **monix-scalaz-72**: exposes [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz)
  type-class instances, see [the intro](/docs/2x/intro/scalaz72.html)

Head over to **[Usage in SBT and Maven](/docs/2x/intro/usage.html)** for 
more details.
