## Abstract

This talk is about a journey: from imperative code to purely
functional one. It starts with a program written in imperative
style. Its weak spots can be quickly recognized: lack of robustness,
testability and maintainability. We seek our salvation in the
functional paradigm, but the road to enlightenment, has many dangerous
and deceivable dead-ends. The quest has a happy ending, as we reach
code that is performant, testable, readable and maintainable. Keep in
mind however that knowledge comes from experience. As once someone
wise said "Its the not the Destination, it's the Journey." Though it
is not a live coding session, it will sure feel like it. Code is
written in Scala, parental guidance is advised.
