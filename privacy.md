This website does not collect personally identifiable information, no first-party cookies are installed that could be used to track visitors, and we strive hard to prevent tracking from any third-party services used to deliver content or to improve the experience.

## Third-Party Services

Some embedded third-party services might drop cookies (e.g. YouTube, Vimeo players), however our implementation activates their "do not track" options when embedded.

- Read [Vimeo's Privacy Policy](https://vimeo.com/privacy){:rel="nofollow",target="_blank"}; note we [embed the player](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001494447-Using-Player-Parameters){:rel="nofollow",target="_blank"} with a `dnt=1` flag that deactivates session cookies and tracking
