  A data type for providing stability and prevent cascading failures in distributed systems.
---

The `CircuitBreaker` is used to provide stability and prevent
cascading failures in distributed systems.

## Purpose

As an example, we have a web application interacting with a remote
third party web service. Let's say the third party has oversold their
capacity and their database melts down under load. Assume that the
database fails in such a way that it takes a very long time to hand
back an error to the third party web service. This in turn makes calls
fail after a long period of time. Back to our web application, the
users have noticed that their form submissions take much longer
seeming to hang. Well the users do what they know to do which is use
the refresh button, adding more requests to their already running
requests. This eventually causes the failure of the web application
due to resource exhaustion. This will affect all users, even those who
are not using functionality dependent on this third party web service.

Introducing circuit breakers on the web service call would cause the
requests to begin to fail-fast, letting the user know that something
is wrong and that they need not refresh their request. This also
confines the failure behavior to only those users that are using
functionality dependent on the third party, other users are no longer
affected as there is no resource exhaustion. Circuit breakers can also
allow savvy developers to mark portions of the site that use the
functionality unavailable, or perhaps show some cached content as
appropriate while the breaker is open.

## How it Works

The circuit breaker models a concurrent state machine that can be in
any of these 3 states:

1. `Closed`: During normal operations or when the `CircuitBreaker` starts
  - Exceptions increment the `failures` counter
  - Successes reset the `failures` counter to zero  
  - When the `failures` counter reaches the `maxFailures` threshold,
    the breaker is tripped into the `Open` state
2. `Open`: The circuit breaker rejects all tasks
  - all tasks fail fast with `ExecutionRejectedException`
  - after the configured `resetTimeout`, the circuit breaker enters a
    `HalfOpen` state, allowing one task to go through for testing the
    connection
3. `HalfOpen`: The circuit breaker has already allowed a task to go
   through, as a reset attempt, in order to test the connection
  - The first task when `Open` has expired is allowed through without
    failing fast, just before the circuit breaker is evolved into the
    `HalfOpen` state    
  - All tasks attempted in `HalfOpen` fail-fast with an exception just
    as in the `Open` state
  - If that task attempt succeeds, the breaker is reset back to the
    `Closed` state, with the `resetTimeout` and the `failures` count
    also reset to initial values
  - If the task attempt fails, the breaker is tripped again into the
    `Open` state (the `resetTimeout` is multiplied by the exponential
    backoff factor, up to the configured `maxResetTimeout`)

## Usage

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
import monix.catnap.CircuitBreaker
import monix.eval._
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val circuitBreaker: Task[CircuitBreaker[Task]] = 
  CircuitBreaker[Task].of(
    maxFailures = 5,
    resetTimeout = 10.seconds
  )
```

Note the builder's returned reference is given in the `Task` context,
because `CircuitBreaker` has shared state and doing otherwise
would violate in some cases referential transparency.

You can workaround it by using the `unsafe` builder, but only do this
if you know what you're doing, otherwise prefer the safe alternative:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
CircuitBreaker[Task].unsafe(
  maxFailures = 5,
  resetTimeout = 10.seconds
)
```

And in order to protect tasks being processed, one can use `protect`:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
val problematic = Task {
  val nr = util.Random.nextInt()
  if (nr % 2 == 0) nr else
    throw new RuntimeException("dummy")
}

for {
  ci <- circuitBreaker
  r  <- ci.protect(problematic)
} yield r
```

When attempting to close the circuit breaker and resume normal
operations, we can also apply an exponential backoff for repeated
failed attempts, like so:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
val circuitBreaker = CircuitBreaker[Task].of(
  maxFailures = 5,
  resetTimeout = 10.seconds,
  exponentialBackoffFactor = 2,
  maxResetTimeout = 10.minutes
)
```

In this sample we attempt to reconnect after 10 seconds, then after
20, 40 and so on, a delay that keeps increasing up to a configurable
maximum of 10 minutes.

### Event Handlers

In case you want to trigger events when the Circuit Breaker changes
its state, like logging or metrics-related:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
CircuitBreaker[Task].of(
  maxFailures = 5,
  resetTimeout = 10.seconds,
  
  onRejected = Task { 
    println("Task rejected in Open or HalfOpen")
  },
  onClosed = Task {
    println("Switched to Close, accepting tasks again")
  },
  onHalfOpen = Task {
    println("Switched to HalfOpen, accepted one task for testing")
  },
  onOpen = Task {
    println("Switched to Open, all incoming tasks rejected for the next 10 seconds")
  }
)
```

### Retrying after Close

In case a retry strategy needs to be implemented, the naive way of
handling it would be to retry with a delay:

```scala mdoc:invisible:nest
val circuitBreaker = 
  CircuitBreaker[Task].unsafe(
    maxFailures = 5,
    resetTimeout = 10.seconds
  )
```

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
val task = circuitBreaker.protect(problematic)

task.onErrorRestartLoop(100.millis) { (e, delay, retry) =>
  // Exponential back-off, but with a limit
  if (delay < 4.seconds)
    retry(delay * 2).delayExecution(delay)
  else
    Task.raiseError(e)
}
```

But on the other hand you can wait for the precise moment the
`CircuitBreaker` closes again:

```scala mdoc:silent:nest
task.onErrorRestartLoop(0) { (e, times, retry) =>
  // Retrying for a maximum of 10 times
  if (times < 10)
    circuitBreaker.awaitClose.flatMap(_ => retry(times + 1))
  else
    Task.raiseError(e)
}
```
