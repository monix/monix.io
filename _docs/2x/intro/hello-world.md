Let's do instant gratification stuff.

First, we need a [Scheduler]({{ site.api2x }}monix/execution/Scheduler.html)
whenever asynchronous execution happens.

```scala mdoc:silent
// We need a scheduler whenever asynchronous
// execution happens, substituting your ExecutionContext
import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global

// Needed below
import scala.concurrent.Await
import scala.concurrent.duration._
```

## Task, the Lazy Future

For using [Task]({{ site.api2x }}monix/eval/Task$.html) or
[Coeval]({{ site.api2x }}monix/eval/Coeval$.html), usage is
fairly similar with Scala's own `Future`, except that
`Task` behaves lazily:

```scala mdoc:silent
import monix.eval._

// A specification for evaluating a sum,
// nothing gets triggered at this point!
val task = Task { 1 + 1 }
```

`Task` in comparison with Scala's `Future` is lazy,
so nothing gets evaluated yet. We can convert it into
a `Future` and evaluate it:

```scala mdoc
// Actual execution, making use of the Scheduler in
// our scope, imported above
val future = task.runAsync
```

We now have a standard `Future`, so we can use its result:

```scala mdoc
// Avoid blocking; this is done for demostrative purposes
Await.result(future, 5.seconds)
```

## Observable, the Lazy & Async Iterable

We already have the `Scheduler` in our local scope,
so lets make a tick that gets triggered every second.

```scala mdoc:silent
import monix.reactive._

// Nothing happens here, as observable is lazily
// evaluated only when the subscription happens!
val tick = {
  Observable.interval(1.second)
    // common filtering and mapping
    .filter(_ % 2 == 0)
    .map(_ * 2)
    // any respectable Scala type has flatMap, w00t!
    .flatMap(x => Observable.fromIterable(Seq(x,x)))
    // only take the first 5 elements, then stop
    .take(5)
    // to print the generated events to console
    .dump("Out")
}
```

Our observable is at this point just a specification. We can evaluate
it by subscribing to it:

```scala
// Execution happens here, after subscribe
val cancelable = tick.subscribe()
// 0: Out-->0
// 1: Out-->0
// 2: Out-->4
// 3: Out-->4
// 4: Out-->8
// 5: Out completed

// Or maybe we change our mind
cancelable.cancel()
```

Isn't this awesome? (✿ ♥‿♥)
