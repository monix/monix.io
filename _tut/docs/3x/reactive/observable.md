## Introduction

The `Observable` is a data type for modeling and processing
asynchronous and reactive streaming of events with non-blocking
back-pressure. 

The `Observable` is strongly inspired by
[ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/), but with an idiomatic Scala API and
influenced by the Scala ecosystem of projects such as
[Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/) and
[Scalaz](http://scalaz.org/). It's also compatible with the
[Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) specification,
hence it has good interoperability.

```scala
// We need a Scheduler in scope in order to make 
// the Observable produce elements when subscribed
import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global
import monix.reactive._

import concurrent.duration._

// We first build an observable that emits a tick per second, 
// the series of elements being an auto-incremented long
val source = Observable.interval(1.second)
  // Filtering out odd numbers, making it emit every 2 seconds
  .filter(_ % 2 == 0)
  // We then make it emit the same element twice
  .flatMap(x => Observable(x, x))
  // This stream would be infinite, so we limit it to 10 items
  .take(10)
  
// Observables are lazy, nothing happens until you subscribe...
val cancelable = source
  // On consuming it, we want to dump the contents to stdout
  // for debugging purposes
  .dump("O")
  // Finally, start consuming it
  .subscribe()

```

At its simplest, `Observable` is a replacement for your regular
[Iterable]({{ site.scalaapi }}#scala.collection.Iterable)
or Scala 
[Stream]({{ site.scalaapi }}#scala.collection.immutable.Stream), 
but with the ability to process asynchronous events without blocking. 
And in fact you can convert any `Iterable` into an `Observable`.

But `Observable` scales to complex problems, touching on
*[functional reactive programming (FRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming)*,
or it can model complex interactions between producers and consumers,
being a potent alternative for
[the actor model](http://akka.io/).

### Design Summary

A visual representation of where it sits in the design space:

|                    |        Single       |           Multiple         |
|:------------------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| **Synchronous**    |          A          |         Iterable[A]        |
| **Asynchronous**   | Future[A] / Task[A] |        Observable[A]       |

The Monix `Observable`:

- models lazy & asynchronous streaming of events
- it is highly composable and lawful
- it's basically the
  [Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)
  on steroids
- you can also think of it as being like a Scala
  [Future]({{ scalaapi }}#scala.concurrent.Future) or like
  a [Task](../eval/task.html), except with the ability to stream 
  multiple items instead of just one, or you can think of it as an asynchronous 
  and non-blocking
  [Iterable]({{ site.scalaapi }}#scala.collection.Iterable)
  with benefits
- models producer-consumer relationships, where you can have a single
  producer pushing data into one or multiple consumers
- works best for unidirectional communications
- allows fine-grained control over the [execution model](../execution/scheduler.html#execution-model)
- doesnâ€™t trigger the execution, or any effects until `subscribe`
- allows for cancelling of active streams
- never blocks any threads in its implementation 
- does not expose any API calls that can block threads
- compatible with [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) like the rest of Monix

See **[comparisons with similar tools, like Akka or FS2](./observable-comparisons.html)**.

### Learning resources

The following documentation barely scratches a surface of `Observable` and is rather incomplete.
If you find it lacking, make sure to check either [Observable API]({{ site.api3x }}monix/reactive/Observable.html) or
comments [in the code](https://github.com/monix/monix) directly. We put a lot of focus on scala docs. 

Other great resource is a [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) documentation and everything about it which opens doors
to plenty of books, blog posts and Stack Overflow answers.
There are significant differences in the model but majority of functions behave the same so it is a fantastic source
of examples and additional explanations.

Last but not least, we are always happy to help on [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/monix/monix). Any feedback
regarding the documentation itself (like confusing wording) is really appreciated too.

## Observable Contract

`Observable` can be thought about as the next layer of abstraction in regard to `Observer` and `Subscriber`.

You could describe `Observable` in the following way:

```scala
trait Observable[+A] {
  def subscribe(o: Observer[A]): Cancelable
}
```

where `Observer` is:

```scala
trait Observer[-T] {
  def onNext(elem: T): Future[Ack]

  def onError(ex: Throwable): Unit

  def onComplete(): Unit
}
```

`Observable` internals respect `Observer` [contract](./observers.html#contract) but you can consider it
being higher level interface which abstracts away details of the contract and handles it for the user. 

### How it works internally

If it is your first contact with this type of stream it probably sounds confusing. The understanding of underlying
model is not necessary to be successful user of `Observable` but if you would like to do it anyway (or perhaps contribute your own low level operators),
I will try to explain the essence of how it works. Note that implementations of many operators are filled with optimizations so they look much more
complicated then they really are.

`Observable` subscribing to `Observer` means that it will pass through the items generated by it which is done calling `onNext`.
Imagine following situation:

```scala
Observable.fromIterable(1 to 3)
  .map(i => i + 2)
  .map(i => i * 3)
  .sum
  .firstL // returns Task[Long]
``` 

`fromIterable` is a builder which creates an `Observable` so it has to implement `subscribe`.
In this method, it would pass each element to `Observer` by calling `onNext` on it, making sure to obey the contract.
Once the sequence is empty it would call `onComplete` to signal that there aren't any elements left to process and entire
`Observable` can end. Note that `observer.onNext(elem)` returns `Future[Ack]`. To obey the contract and preserve backpressure,
we have to wait for its' result until we pass the next element. `Ack` can be either `Continue` (ok to send next element) or `Stop` (we should shut down).
It means we have a way to stop downstream (by calling `onComplete`) and an upstream (returning `Stop` after `onNext`).

`map` is essentially `Observer => Observer` function. It implements `onNext`, `onError` and `onComplete`.
 The happy path goes like this:

```
(1) fromIterable calls map1.onNext(i)
(2) map1 does transformation and calls map2.onNext(i + 2)
(3) map2 does transformation and calls sumL.onNext(i * 3)
(4) sum  saves and acknowledges incoming items and does not call firstL.onNext until it receives onComplete
(5) firstL waits for the first onNext to complete a Task
```

Points (1) to (3) go in loop until the entire sequence of numbers is consumed. 
When `sum` acknowledges (returns from `onNext` method) to `map2`, `map2` can acknowledge to `map1` which in turn
acknowledges to `fromIterable` and a new item can be sent. 
In case any `onNext` returns a `Stop`, it would also propagate upstream and there wouldn't be any new items generated.

Now if you jump into the source code of operators, you will see that they are obfuscated by concurrency, error handling
and lots of optimizations but the essence of the model works as described above. There is nothing more to it, no extra
interpreters or materializers to add an extra layer of indirection so if this section makes sense to you, you should have
a decent idea of what's going on "behind the scenes". 

## Observable and Functional Programming

`Observable` internals are written in imperative, Java-like style. It doesn't look pretty and can be discouraging
if you're trying to write your own operator but together with relatively simple model (in terms of operations to do) it
buys a lot of performance and is a big reason why it does so well [in comparison to competition](https://github.com/monix/streaming-benchmarks).

However, `Observable` exposes a vast number of purely functional operators that compose very well and you can build on top of them in
similar way to how it's done in other streaming libraries from FP ecosystem.

If you're mostly using available methods and want to write purely functional application then you're in luck because
dirty internals don't leak outside and majority of API is pure and the process of constructing and executing `Observable` is also pure.

The main drawback in comparison to purely functional streams, such as [fs2](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2) or
[Iterant]({{ site.api3x }}monix/tail/Iterant.html) is availability of impure functions in API so if you have inexperienced 
team members, they could be tempted to use them. Fortunately, all of them are marked with `@UnsafeBecauseImpure` annotation and explained in ScalaDoc. 
There should always be a referentially transparent replacement to solve your use case but if your team is not fully committed to FP, these functions can be very useful.

For instance, convenient way to share `Observable` is using `Hot Observable` but it's not referentially transparent.
Nevertheless, you could do the same thing using `doOnNext` or `doOnNextF` and purely functional concurrency structures from `Cats-Effect` such as `Ref` or `MVar` to share state in more controlled manner.

Decision is up to the user to choose what's better for them and their team.

## Execution

When you create `Observable` nothing actually happens until you call `subscribe`. 
It means that (apart from impure parts of API) `Observable` preserves referential transparency. 

`Subscribe` is considered low-level operator and it is advised not to use it unless you know exactly what you are doing. 
You can think about it as `unsafePerformIO`.

Preferred way to deal with `Observable` is to convert it to [Task](./../eval/task.html) and compose it all the way
through your program until the very end (Main method).

Two main ways to convert `Observable` to `Task` are described below.

### Consumer

One of the ways to trigger `Observable` is to use [Consumer](./consumer.html) which can be described as a function that converts `Observable` into `Task`.

You can either create your own `Consumer` or use one of many prebuilt ones:

```scala
val list: Observable[Long] = 
    Observable.range(0, 1000)
      .take(100)
      .map(_ * 2)
      
val consumer: Consumer[Long, Long] =
    Consumer.foldLeft(0L)(_ + _)
    
val task: Task[Long] =
    list.consumeWith(consumer)
```

You can find more examples in [Consumer documentation](./consumer.html).

### FoldLeft Methods

Any method suffixed with `L` in `Observable` API converts it into `Task`.

For example you can use `firstL` to obtain the first element of the `Observable`:
```scala
// Task(0)
val task: Task[Int] = Observable.range(0, 1000).firstL
```

Equivalent to the `Task` described in previous section would be:

```scala
val list: Observable[Long] = 
    Observable.range(0, 1000)
      .take(100)
      .map(_ * 2)
       
val task: Task[Long] =
    list.foldLeftL(0L)(_ + _)
```
## Building Observable

You can find them in `Observable` companion object. Below are several examples:

### Observable.pure (now)

`Observable.pure` (alias for `now`) simply lifts an already known 
value in the `Observable` context.

```tut:reset:invisible
import monix.reactive.Observable
import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global
import monix.execution.exceptions.DummyException
```

```tut:silent
val obs = Observable.now { println("Effect"); "Hello!" }
//=> Effect
// obs: monix.reactive.Observable[String] = NowObservable@327a283b
```
 
### Observable.delay (eval)

`Observable.delay` (alias for `eval`) lifts non-strict
value in the `Observable`. It is evaluated upon subscription.

```tut:silent
val obs = Observable.delay { println("Effect"); "Hello!" }
// obs: monix.reactive.Observable[String] = EvalAlwaysObservable@48a8050
val task = obs.foreachL(println)
// task: monix.eval.Task[Unit] = Task.Async$1782722529

task.runToFuture
//=> Effect
//=> Hello!

// The evaluation (and thus all contained side effects)
// gets triggered on each runToFuture:
task.runToFuture
//=> Effect
//=> Hello!
```

### Observable.evalOnce

`Observable.evalOnce` takes a non-strict value and converts it into an Observable
that emits a single element and that memoizes the value for subsequent invocations.
It also has guaranteed idempotency and thread-safety:

```tut:silent
val obs = Observable.evalOnce { println("Effect"); "Hello!" }
// obs: monix.reactive.Observable[String] = EvalOnceObservable@3233e694
val task = obs.foreachL(println)
// task: monix.eval.Task[Unit] = Task.Async$1782722529

task.runToFuture
//=> Effect
//=> Hello!

// Result was memoized on the first run!
task.runToFuture.foreach(println)
//=> Hello!
```

### Observable.fromIterable

`Observable.fromIterable` converts any `Iterable` into `Observable`:

```tut:silent
val obs = Observable.fromIterable(List(1, 2, 3))
// obs: monix.reactive.Observable[Int] = IterableAsObservable@7b0e123d

obs.foreachL(println).runToFuture
//=> 1
//=> 2
//=> 3
```

### Observable.suspend (defer)

`Observable.suspend` (alias for defer) allows suspending side effects:

```tut:silent
import monix.eval.Task
import monix.reactive.Observable
import scala.io.Source

def readFile(path: String): Observable[String] = 
    Observable.suspend {
        // The side effect won't happen until subscription
        val lines = Source.fromFile(path).getLines
        Observable.fromIterator(Task(lines))
    }
```

### Observable.raiseError

`Observable.raiseError` constructs an Observable that calls `onError` on any subscriber emitting specified `Exception`:

```tut:silent
val observable = Observable.raiseError[Int](new Exception("my exception"))
// observable: monix.reactive.Observable[Int]

{
observable
  .onErrorHandle {ex => println(s"Got exception: ${ex.getMessage}"); 1}
  .foreachL(println)
}
//=> Got exception: my exception
//=> 1
```

## Sending elements to Observable

There are several options to feed `Observable` with elements from other part of the application.

### ConcurrentQueue

`monix-catnap` module provides [ConcurrentQueue](https://monix.io/api/3.0/monix/catnap/ConcurrentQueue.html) that can be used
with `Observable.repeatEvalF` builder to create `Observable` from it.

```tut:silent
import monix.catnap.ConcurrentQueue
import monix.eval.Task
import monix.reactive.Observable

def feedItem[A](queue: ConcurrentQueue[Task, A], item: A): Task[Unit] = {
  queue.offer(item)
}

def processStream[A](observable: Observable[A]): Task[Unit] = {
  observable
    .mapParallelUnordered(3)(i => Task(println(i)))
    .completedL
}

{
  ConcurrentQueue.unbounded[Task, Int]().flatMap { queue =>
    Task
      .parZip2(
        feedItem(queue, 2),
        processStream(Observable.repeatEvalF(queue.poll))
      )
  }
}
```

If you're curious why we have to `flatMap` [see excellent presentation by Fabio Labella](https://vimeo.com/294736344).
Note that you can also create `Observable` from other tools for Concurrency, such as `MVar` or `Deferred`.

### ConcurrentSubject

If you're not afraid to get your hands dirty, then you can use `ConcurrentSubject` to get equivalent functionality:

```tut:silent
import monix.eval.Task
import monix.execution.Ack
import monix.reactive.subjects.ConcurrentSubject
import monix.reactive.{MulticastStrategy, Observable, Observer}

val subject: ConcurrentSubject[Int, Int] =
  ConcurrentSubject[Int](MulticastStrategy.replay)

def feedItem[A](observer: Observer[A], item: A): Task[Ack] = {
  Task.deferFuture(observer.onNext(item))
}

def processStream[A](observable: Observable[A]): Task[Unit] = {
  observable
    .mapParallelUnordered(3)(i => Task(println(i)))
    .completedL
}

{
Task
  .parZip2(
    feedItem(subject, 2),
    processStream(subject)
  )
}
```

In this case we transformed `Future` to `Task` so the example is pure (other than not suspending `ConcurrentSubject` creation) but you
don't have to do that if you prefer staying with `Future`.

[More on Subjects later.](/observable.html#subjects)

## Scheduling

`Observable` is a great fit not only for streaming data but also for control flow such as scheduling. 
It provides several builders for this purpose and it's easy to combine it with `Task` if all you want is to
run a `Task` in specific intervals.

### intervalWithFixedDelay (interval)

`Observable.intervalWithFixedDelay` takes a `delay` and an optional `initialDelay`. It creates an `Observable` that
emits auto-incremented natural numbers (longs) spaced by a given time interval. Starts from 0 with `initialDelay` (or immediately), 
after which it emits incremented numbers spaced by the `delay` of time. The given `delay` of time acts as a fixed 
delay between successive events.

```tut:silent
import monix.eval.Task
import monix.execution.schedulers.TestScheduler
import monix.reactive.Observable

import scala.concurrent.duration._

// using `TestScheduler` to manipulate time
implicit val sc = TestScheduler()

val stream: Task[Unit] = {
  Observable
    .intervalWithFixedDelay(2.second)
    .mapEval(l => Task.sleep(2.second).map(_ => l))
    .foreachL(println)
}

stream.runToFuture(sc)

sc.tick(2.second) // prints 0
sc.tick(4.second) // prints 1
sc.tick(4.second) // prints 2
sc.tick(4.second) // prints 3
```

### intervalAtFixedRate

`Observable.intervalAtFixedRate` is similar to `Observable.intervalWithFixedDelay` but the time it takes to
process an `onNext` event gets substracted from the specified `period` time. In other words, the created `Observable`
tries to emit events spaced by the given time interval, regardless of how long the processing of `onNext` takes.

The difference should be clearer after looking at the example below. 
Notice how it makes up for time spent in each `mapEval`.

```tut:silent
import monix.eval.Task
import monix.execution.schedulers.TestScheduler
import monix.reactive.Observable

import scala.concurrent.duration._

// using `TestScheduler` to manipulate time
implicit val sc = TestScheduler()

val stream: Task[Unit] = {
  Observable
    .intervalAtFixedRate(2.second)
    .mapEval(l => Task.sleep(2.second).map(_ => l))
    .foreachL(println)
}

stream.runToFuture(sc)

sc.tick(2.second) // prints 0
sc.tick(2.second) // prints 1
sc.tick(2.second) // prints 2
sc.tick(2.second) // prints 3
```

## Error Handling

Failing in any operator in `Observable` will lead to termination of the stream. It will inform downstream and upstream
about the failure, stopping entire `Observable` unless the error is handled.

Note that most errors should be handled at `Effect` level (e.g. `Task`, `IO` in `mapEval`), not by using `Observable` error handling operators. 
If `Observable` encounters an error it cannot ignore it and keep going. The best you can do without bigger machinery is to restart `Observable` or replace it with different one.

### handleError (onErrorHandle)

`Observable.handleError` (alias for `onErrorHandle`) mirrors original source unless error happens - in which case it fallbacks to an `Observable` emitting one specified element generated by given total function.

```tut:silent
import monix.reactive.Observable

val observable = Observable(1, 2, 3) ++ Observable.raiseError(new Exception) ++ Observable(0)

{
observable
  .onErrorHandle(_ => 4)
  .foreachL(println)
}
//=> 1
//=> 2
//=> 3
//=> 4
```

### handleErrorWith (onErrorHandleWith)

`Observable.handleErrorWith` (alias for `onErrorHandleWith`) mirrors original source unless error happens - in which case it fallbacks to an `Observable` generated by given total function.

```tut:silent
import monix.reactive.Observable

val observable = Observable(1, 2) ++ Observable.raiseError(new Exception) ++ Observable(0)

{
observable
  .onErrorHandleWith(_ => Observable(3, 4))
  .foreachL(println)
}
//=> 1
//=> 2
//=> 3
//=> 4
```

### recover (onErrorRecover)

`Observable.recover` (alias for `onErrorRecover`) mirrors original source unless error happens - in which case it fallbacks to an `Observable` emitting one specified element generated by given partial function. The difference between `recover` and `handleError` is that the latter takes total function as a parameter.

### recoverWith (onErrorRecoverWith)

`Observable.recoverWith` (alias for `onErrorRecoverWith`) mirrors original source unless error happens - in which case it fallbacks to an `Observable` generated by given partial function. The difference between `recoverWith` and `handleErrorWith` is that the latter takes total function as a parameter.

### onErrorFallbackTo

`Observable.onErrorFallbackTo` mirrors the behavior of the source, unless it is terminated with an `onError`, in which case the streaming of events continues with the specified backup sequence regardless of error.

```tut:silent
import monix.reactive.Observable

val observable = Observable(1, 2) ++ Observable.raiseError(new Exception) ++ Observable(0)

{
observable
  .onErrorFallbackTo(Observable(3, 4))
  .foreachL(println)
}
//=> 1
//=> 2
//=> 3
//=> 4
```

This is equivalent to:
```scala
{
observable
  .handleErrorWith(_ => Observable(3, 4))
}
```

### onErrorRestart

`Observable.onErrorRestart` mirrors the behavior of the source unless it is terminated with an `onError`, in which case it tries subscribing to the source again in the hope that it will complete without an error.

The number of retries is limited by the specified `maxRetries` parameter.

There is also `onErrorRestartUnlimited` variant for unlimited number of retries.

### onErrorRestartIf

`Observable.onErrorRestartIf` mirrors the behavior of the source unless it is terminated with an `onError`, in which case it invokes provided function and tries subscribing to the source again in the hope that it will complete without an error.

```tut:silent
import monix.reactive.Observable

case object TimeoutException extends Exception

val observable = Observable(1, 2) ++ Observable.raiseError(TimeoutException) ++ Observable(0)

{
observable
  .onErrorRestartIf {
    case TimeoutException => true
    case _ => false
  }
  .foreachL(println)
}
//=> 1
//=> 2
//=> 3
//=> 1
//=> 2
//=> 3
// ... fails and restarts infinitely
```

### Retrying with delay

Since `Observable` methods compose pretty nicely you could easily combine them to write custom retry mechanism:

```tut:silent
def retryWithDelay[A](source: Observable[A], delay: FiniteDuration): Observable[A] = 
  source.onErrorHandleWith { _ =>
    retryWithDelay(source, delay).delayExecution(delay)
  }
```

Which can be customized further. For example, we can add exponential backoff:

```tut:silent
def retryBackoff[A](source: Observable[A],
  maxRetries: Int, firstDelay: FiniteDuration): Observable[A] = {
  source.onErrorHandleWith {
    case ex: Exception =>
      if (maxRetries > 0)
        retryBackoff(source, maxRetries-1, firstDelay*2)
          .delayExecution(firstDelay)
      else
        Observable.raiseError(ex)
  }
}
```

### Dropping failed elements

Sometimes we would like to ignore elements that caused failure and keep going but 
if something fails in `Observable` operator (e.g. mapEval) the entire `Observable` is failed with this error.

```tut:silent
val observable = Observable(1, 2, 3)

def task(i: Int): Task[Int] = {
  if (i == 2) Task.raiseError(DummyException("error"))
  else Task(i)
}

{
observable
  .mapEval(task)
  .foreachL(e => println(s"elem: $e"))
}
//=> elem: 1
//=> Exception in thread "main" monix.execution.exceptions.DummyException: error
```

There is nothing like supervision in Akka Streams but if we control it at the `Effect` level, we could achieve similar behavior.
For instance, we could wrap our elements in `Option` or `Either` and then do `collect { case Right(e) => e }`.

```tut:silent
val observable = Observable(1, 2, 3)

def task(i: Int): Task[Int] = {
  if (i == 2) Task.raiseError(DummyException("error"))
  else Task(i)
}

{
observable
  .mapEval(task(_).attempt) // attempt transforms Task[A] into Task[Either[Throwable, A]] with all errors handled
  .collect { case Right(evt) => evt}
  .foreachL(e => println(s"elem: $e"))
}

//=> elem: 1
//=> elem: 3
```

It's not as nice as having one global Supervisor that handles it if something goes wrong but as long as you follow
basic rules such as not throwing exceptions and remembering that any `Task` can fail then you should be good to go.

### MonadError instance

`Observable` provides `MonadError[Observable, Throwable]` instance so you can use any `MonadError` operator for error handling.
If you are curious what it gives you in practice, check methods in [cats.MonadError](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/cats/MonadError.scala) and [cats.ApplicativeError](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/cats/ApplicativeError.scala). 

Many of these methods (and more) are defined directly on `Observable` and the rest can be acquired by calling `import cats.implicits._`.

## Reacting to internal events

If you remember, `Observable` internally calls `onNext` on every element, `onError` during error and `onComplete` after
stream completion. There are many many methods for executing given callback when the stream acquires specific type of event.
Usually they start with `doOn` or `doAfter`.

### doOnNext

Executes given callback for each element generated by the source `Observable`, useful for doing side-effects.

```tut:silent
var counter = 0
val observable = Observable(1, 2, 3)

{
observable
  .doOnNext(e => Task(counter += e))
  .foreachL(e => println(s"elem: $e, counter: $counter"))
}
//=> elem: 1, counter: 1
//=> elem: 2, counter: 3
//=> elem: 3, counter: 6
```

You could also write it preserving referential transparency using `Ref` from `Cats-Effect`:

```tut:silent
import cats.effect.concurrent.Ref
import monix.eval.Task
import monix.reactive.Observable

def observable(counterRef: Ref[Task, Int]): Task[Unit] = {
  Observable(1, 2, 3)
    .doOnNext(e => counterRef.update(_ + e))
    .mapEval(e => counterRef.get.map(counter => println(s"elem: $e, counter: $counter")))
    .completedL
}

Ref[Task].of(0).flatMap(observable)
// After executing:
//=> elem: 1, counter: 1
//=> elem: 2, counter: 3
//=> elem: 3, counter: 6
```

There is also `doOnNextF` variant which works for data types other than `Task`.

## Subjects

`Subject` acts both as an `Observer` and as an `Observable`. Use `Subject` if you need to send elements to `Observable`
from other parts of the application.
It is presented in the following example:

```tut:silent
import monix.eval.Task
import monix.execution.Ack
import monix.reactive.subjects.ConcurrentSubject
import monix.reactive.{MulticastStrategy, Observable, Observer}

val subject: ConcurrentSubject[Int, Int] =
  ConcurrentSubject[Int](MulticastStrategy.replay)

def feedItem[A](observer: Observer[A], item: A): Task[Ack] = {
  Task.deferFuture(observer.onNext(item))
}

def processStream[A](observable: Observable[A]): Task[Unit] = {
  observable
    .mapParallelUnordered(3)(i => Task(println(i)))
    .completedL
}

{
Task
  .parZip2(
    feedItem(subject, 2),
    processStream(subject)
  )
}
```

Other use case for `Subject` includes sharing it. There are several strategies available and you can find their short characteristics below.

- `AsyncSubject` emits the last value (and only the last value) emitted by the source and only after the source completes.
- `BehaviorSubject` emits the most recently emitted item by the source, or the `initialValue` in case no value has yet been emitted, then continue to emit events subsequent to the time of invocation.
- `ConcurrentSubject` allows feeding events without the need to respect the back-pressure (waiting on `Ack` after `onNext`). It is similar to [Actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) and can serve as its replacement in many cases.
- `PublishSubject` emits to a subscriber only those items that are emitted by the source subsequent to the time of the subscription.
- `PublishToOneSubject` is a `PublishSubject` that can be susbcribed at most once.
- `ReplaySubject` emits to a subscriber all of the items that were emitted by the source, regardless of when the observer subsribes.
- `Var` emits the most recently emmited item by the source, or the `initial` in case no value has yet been emitted, then continue to emit events subsequent to the time of invocation via an underlying `ConcurrentSubject`. This is equivalent to a `ConcurrentSubject.behavior(Unbounder)` with ability to expose the current value for immediate usage on top of that.

For more information refer to descriptions and methods in `monix.reactive.subjects` package.

## Hot and Cold Observables

As mentioned before - by default `Observable` doesn't emit any items until something subscribes to it. 
This type is called *cold Observable.*
In cold Observable there is only one subscriber who is guaranteed to see all the emitted items.

On the other hand there is also a notion of *hot Observable* denoted as `ConnectableObservable` whose source is shared between many subscribers. 
It means that it matters when you subscribe to it and the order of subscription can affect your program.
For this reason tread carefully when using `ConnectableObservable` because it breaks referential transparency.

### Turning cold Observable into hot Observable

There are several methods which turn `Observable` into `ConnectableObservable` using corresponding `Subject`.

### Observable.publish (PublishSubject)
`Observable.publish` will convert this `Observable` into a multicast `Observable` using
`PublishSubject` which emits to a subscriber only those items that are emitted by the source subsequent to the time of the subscription.

```tut:silent
var result = 0
val observable = Observable(1, 2, 3).publish

observable.foreach(e => result += e)

// Start the streaming
observable.connect()

// result == 6

// happens after all items are emitted so it doesn't add anything
observable.foreach(e => result += e)

// result == 6 
```

### Observable.publishLast (AsyncSubject)
`Observable.publishLast` uses `AsyncSubject` as underlying `Subject` which emits only the last value emitted by the source
and only after the source completes.

```tut:silent
var result = 0
val observable = Observable(1, 2, 3).publishLast

observable.foreach(e => result += e)

// Start the streaming
observable.connect()

// result == 3
```

### Observable.replay (ReplaySubject)
`Observable.replay` is powered by `ReplaySubject` which emits to any observer all of the items that were emitted by the source, 
regardless of when the observer subscribes. 

```tut:silent
var result = 0
val observable = Observable(1, 2, 3).replay

// Start the streaming
observable.connect()

observable.foreach(e => result += e)

// result == 6
```

It optionally takes `bufferSize` parameter which limits the number
of items that can be replayed (on overflow the head starts being dropped):

```tut:silent
var result = 0
val observable = Observable(1, 2, 3).replay(1)

// Start the streaming
observable.connect()

observable.foreach(e => result += e)

// result == 3
```

### Observable.behavior (BehaviorSubject)
`Observable.behavior` relies on `BehaviorSubject` which is emitting the most recently emitted item by the source, or
the `initialValue` (as the seed) in case no value has yet been emitted.

```tut:silent
var result = 0
val observable = Observable(1, 2, 3).behavior(0)

// Start the streaming
observable.connect()

observable.foreach(e => result += e)

// result == 3
```

## Interoperability with other Streams API (Akka Streams, FS2)

Due to compability with the [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/)
specification `Observable` allows good interoperability with other libraries.

The next subsections contain examples how to convert between Monix `Observable` and
two other popular streaming libraries but it should work in similar way with every other library
compatible with Reactive Streams protocol.

### Akka Streams

Necessary imports and initialization for `Akka Streams`:

```scala
import monix.reactive.Observable
import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global
import akka._
import akka.stream._
import akka.stream.scaladsl._
import akka.actor.ActorSystem

implicit val system = ActorSystem("akka-streams")
implicit val materializer = ActorMaterializer()
```

To convert Akka `Source` to Monix `Observable`:

```scala
val source = Source(1 to 3)
// source: akka.stream.scaladsl.Source[Int,akka.NotUsed] = Source(SourceShape(StatefulMapConcat.out(1887925338)))

val publisher = source.runWith(Sink.asPublisher[Int](fanout = false))
// publisher: org.reactivestreams.Publisher[Int] = VirtualPublisher(state = Publisher[StatefulMapConcat.out(1887925338)])

val observable = Observable.fromReactivePublisher(publisher)
// observable: monix.reactive.Observable[Int] = monix.reactive.internal.builders.ReactiveObservable@72f8ecd
```

To go back from Monix `Observable` to Akka `Source`:

```scala
val observable = Observable(1, 2, 3)
// observable: monix.reactive.Observable[Int] = monix.reactive.internal.builders.IterableAsObservable@4783cc8

val source = Source.fromPublisher(observable.toReactivePublisher)
// source: akka.stream.scaladsl.Source[Int,akka.NotUsed] = Source(SourceShape(PublisherSource.out(989856637)))
```

### FS2

To go between [FS2](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2) Stream 
and Monix `Observable` you need to use [fs2-reactive-streams](https://github.com/zainab-ali/fs2-reactive-streams)
library but conversion remains very straightforward.

Necessary imports:

```scala
import cats.effect._, fs2._
import fs2.interop.reactivestreams._
import monix.reactive.Observable
import monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global
```

To convert FS2 `Stream` to Monix `Observable`:

```scala
val stream = Stream(1, 2, 3).covary[IO]
// stream: fs2.Stream[cats.effect.IO,Int] = Stream(..)

val publisher = stream.toUnicastPublisher()
// publisher: fs2.interop.reactivestreams.StreamUnicastPublisher[cats.effect.IO,Int] = fs2.interop.reactivestreams.StreamUnicastPublisher@6418f777

val observable = Observable.fromReactivePublisher(publisher)
// observable: monix.reactive.Observable[Int] = monix.reactive.internal.builders.ReactiveObservable@7130d725
```

To go back from Monix `Observable` to FS2 `Stream`:

```scala
val observable = Observable(1, 2, 3)
// observable: monix.reactive.Observable[Int] = monix.reactive.internal.builders.IterableAsObservable@4783cc8

val stream = observable.toReactivePublisher.toStream[IO]
// stream: fs2.Stream[cats.effect.IO,Int] = Stream(..)
```
